# Demo code
## Inference TRG on video

If you have a video that you want to run inference on, place it in the example directory and execute the code. This will produce a rendered video.

If you want a sample video, you can simply download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ne-SizKgqcEjeD4D3bPN9msoEZT0Pqk4?usp=drive_link)

Please run the following code in the root directory (TRG-Release/).

```
bash run_demo_video.sh
```
